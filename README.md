# money-owe-app
Create an expense-sharing application API. Design an API for an expense-sharing application in which you can add your expenses and split it among different people. The app keeps balances between people as in who owes how much to whom and updates the ledger collection whenever the API is called. The distribution of the amount can be of two types “EQUAL” or “EXACT”. The schema is  designed user wise where the amount he owes to other users is kept in his record unders the property “owes” which is an array of objects and contains the amount which the user owes to the particular user.


## NOTE: Errors are not handled in this code so avoid giving invalid parameters in postman else app will be crased.
